= Scutiger

Scutiger is a collection of general-purpose Git utilities for people who use Git a lot.

This crate provides the Git LFS-specific utilities.

== Included Utilities

=== git-lfs-transfer

`git-lfs-transfer` provides an experimental server-side implementation of the proposed Git LFS pure SSH-based protocol.
This utility is intended to be invoked over SSH to transfer data from one repository to another.
https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/proposals/ssh_adapter.md[The Git LFS documentation outlines the protocol.]

At this moment, the implementation does not support locking and it remains experimental.

This utility should be fully functional on Unix systems, with the normal Git-related exceptions about case-insensitive systems.
It is tested to build on Windows only with a minimal stable Rust toolchain, provided Windows 10 or 11 with Developer Mode is used.
https://github.com/bk2204/.github/blob/dev/SUPPORTED.adoc[The supported platforms policy] otherwise applies.

Note well that https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87945[Rust has a security problem invoking binaries without an absolute path on Windows].
Until Rust is fixed, this software should not be used on Windows since it may execute arbitrary code.
This is a vulnerability in Rust and will not be treated as a vulnerability in this software.
