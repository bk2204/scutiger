scutiger (0.2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Split out the git-lfs-transfer code into a library for reuse.
  * Structure the code to use a generic backend interface.
  * Add support for hash algorithm negotiation.  Note that we continue to
    support only SHA-256, as does the client.
  * Add support for the final version of the Git LFS transfer protocol which is
    to be shipped in Git LFS 3.0.0.
